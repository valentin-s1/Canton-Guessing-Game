# üá®üá≠ Guess the Canton ‚Äì A Swiss Canton Guessing Game

## Project Overview

A Python-based quiz game to guess Swiss cantons based on various hints such as population size, capital city, language, or geographic region. 
The game is text-based, interactive, and designed for casual learning and entertainment.
This repository serves as the **submission of the mandatory group project for course "8,789,1 | Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" taught by Dr. Mario Silic at the University of St.Gallen in the fall semester of 2024.**


#### How It Works

- Players can choose the number of rounds (4,8,or 12) and enter the name (for Leaderboard)
- Each round, a hidden canton is randomly selected.
- It starts with one hard hint (worth 10 points) when clicking "Next hint" the user gets an easier clue (each costs 1 point)
- The player has 2 attempts and 45 seconds to guess
- Input is checked ussing fuzzy matching (>85% similarity is correct)
- Correct guesses earn the remaining points.
- Wrong guesses reduce attempts or end the round.
- Your score accumulates across rounds and at the end, your final score is shown.
- The leaderboard is updated with your best score (by name).
- Once all rounds are played, the leaderboard is displayed, and the game can be played again.

## Programming Language and Libraries

- **Language**: Python
- **Main Packagees**:
  - 'streamlit': Builds the interactive web app, allowing users to interact witht he game directly in their browser.
  - 'streamlit_autorefresh': Enables automatic refreshing the page, which is used for updating the countdown timer in real time.
  - 'random': Built-in Python module used to randomly select cantons and hints, making each game session unique.
  - 'time': Tracks countdowns and ensuring the game enforces a time limit.
  - 'pandas': Used to load and filter the data from Excel
  - 'rapidfuzz': Allows fuzzy mathcing to tolerate small typos in user input.

## Data Structure

Game data is stored in 'data_new_long_format.xlsx'///////////, containing: 
- canton: The correct answer for each hint
- difficulty: Numeric difficulty level (1-10)
- type: Hint category
- hint: the actual clue shown to the user

## Code Architecture

The game runs throguh four main stages, with persistent variables managed using 'st.session_state'.

#### 1. Set-up and Initialization
- Imports necessary modules and deines a cached data loader
- Loades the Excel data into a DataFrame and extracts all unique cantons.
- Initialize Leaderboard to track top scores
- Initializes session variables:
  - Score and round tracking
  - current difficulty and hints
  - guesses left, timing and player input fields

#### 2. Start Screen
- Displays game instructions and rules using an expandable info box
- Allows players to select the number of rounds (either 4, 8 or 12)
- Shows the leaderboard (top 5 scores)

#### 3. Name Input
- Prompts user to enter a name before gameplay begins
- Starts the timer for the first round upon submission

#### 4. Gameplay
- Each round:
  - Starts with a hard hint (difficulty 10 = 10 points)
  - Offers the option to request new hints (easier ones, i.e. reducing possible score)
  - Allows two guesses per round
  - Includes a real-time countdown (45 sec per round)
- Input is checked using fuzxx string matching (> 85% similarity --> to ensure correct answers even with typos)
- After a correc guess, time-out, or two failed attempts:
  - The round ends with feedback and the correct answer (if wrong/time-out)
  - The next round begins automatically after 2 seconds
 
#### 5. Game Over and Replay
- Shows final score out of maximum possible points (depending on choosen rounds)
- Updates leaderboard, keeping the user's highest score
- Provides an option to replay while preserving leaderboard history

## Work procedure
- We used iterative testing to identify and fix issues throughout development.
- For example we noticed that minor typos in canton names caused correct answers to be marked wrong. We then integrated the rapidfuzz package for fuzzy matching to allow close-but-not-exact guesses (‚â•85% similarity).
- Or we also adjusted the scoring system to fairly reflect hint difficulty and attempts used.
- Repeated testing helped us balance gameplay and improve user experience.

## Prerequisites

Install reqiured packages using pip

```bash
pip install streamlit streamlit-autorefresh rapidfuzz
```

Clone this repository onto your local drive with [git](https://git-scm.com/).

```bash
git clone https:/github.com/valentin-s1/Canton-Guessing-Game
```

## Usage

To run the game, simply navigate to the folder containing the source code and execute [game_Noe_v3.py](https://github.com/valentin-s1/Canton-Guessing-Game/Code/game_Noe_v3.py).

``` bash
cd .../tictactoe 
streamlit run Code/game_Noe_v3.py
```

Consequently, a game window opens where the user can click the corresponding buttons and tiles to play the game.
